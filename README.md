# Bokkusu
A simple, but elegant DIY Eurorack Case

## Concept
Bokkusu (ボックス, "box" in Japanese) is a DIY case concept for the Eurorack format. The main design principle was to create a no-compromise case for your Eurorack modules. The main parts are easy to manufacture locally as all plywood panels are rectangle shapes, which is easy to order from a local woodworking shop. The box itself can then be assembled in your home with minimal tools and skills required. Finally, the rails and electronics can be added to finish up the build.
The box itself is made out of plywood cut precisely. The default size for the case is 9U by 84 HP. This can be tweaked by modifying the dimensions in the BOM sheet, however this is not yet tested or advised. It is highly recommended you get a good understanding of what parts go where as modified dimension can propagate to related parts.
The power supply to be used is outside the scope of this project, but I can recommend using something like the RT-65B by MEAN WELL. If you do not feel confident wiring mains voltage in your case having a wall adapter and a power distribution module is a safe bet, so you can avoid routing mains into the case. For this the uZEUS with a Flying Busboard or something similar could be a nice solution.
